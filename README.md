This is my first attempt at writing Julia 1.1 code and, to a large extent, a
simplified port of the `TRIQS/atom_diag` library.

Special thanks to Joseph Kleinhenz for reviewing my code, as well as for writing
the [Keldysh.jl](https://github.com/kleinhenz/Keldysh.jl) library, which `KeldyshED.jl`
depends on.

Some usage examples can be found in the `test` subdirectory.
